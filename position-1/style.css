/* In the above code, each CSS class represents a different position:
.static: Represents the default position of an element in the normal document flow. It does not require any additional positioning properties.
.relative: Represents a position relative to its normal position. The top and left properties are used to offset the element from its original position.
.fixed: Represents a position that is fixed relative to the viewport. The top and right properties are used to position the element.
.absolute: Represents a position that is absolute relative to its closest positioned ancestor. The top and left properties are used to position the element.
.sticky: Represents a position that is initially static but becomes fixed once it reaches a specified scroll position. The top property is used to specify the offset at which the element becomes sticky.
You can apply these CSS classes to your HTML elements as needed. For example: */
