#### Explanation of the CSS Code

The given CSS code is used to style a container element and its child div elements using flexbox. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

```css
.container > div {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    cursor: pointer;
    &:hover {
        transform: scale(1.05);
    }
}
```

- The selector `.container > div` targets all direct child `div` elements of the container with the class name "container".
- The `display: flex;` property is used to create a flex container, which allows the child elements to be laid out in a flexible manner.
- The `flex-direction: column;` property sets the direction of the flex container to be vertical, stacking the child elements from top to bottom.
- The `align-items: center;` property centers the child elements horizontally within the container.
- The `justify-content: center;` property centers the child elements vertically within the container.
- The `width: 100%;` and `height: 100%;` properties set the width and height of the container to occupy the entire available space.
- The `background-color: #fff;` property sets the background color of the container to white.
- The `border-radius: 10px;` property adds rounded corners to the container.
- The `box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);` property adds a subtle shadow effect to the container.
- The `padding: 20px;` property adds 20 pixels of padding around the content of the container.
- The `margin: 20px;` property adds 20 pixels of margin around the container.
- The `position: relative;` property sets the positioning context for the container.
- The `overflow: hidden;` property hides any content that exceeds the dimensions of the container.
- The `transition: all 0.3s ease;` property adds a smooth transition effect to all CSS properties with a duration of 0.3 seconds and an easing function.
- The `cursor: pointer;` property changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the container.
- The `&:hover` selector targets the container when it is being hovered over.
- The `transform: scale(1.05);` property scales the container by 105% when it is being hovered over.

This CSS code creates a container with centered and vertically stacked child elements, and applies various styling properties to enhance its appearance. The use of flexbox allows for flexible and responsive layouts.
