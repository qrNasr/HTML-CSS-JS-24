The provided CSS code styles the `h1` element with various visual properties. Let's break down each property and its purpose:

1. **Border-radius: 10;**
   - This property attempts to set the border radius of the element to 10, but it seems to be missing the unit (e.g., pixels) for the value. It should be `border-radius: 10px;` to specify the radius in pixels.

2. **Background-color: DodgerBlue;**
   - This property sets the background color of the element to "DodgerBlue".

3. **Color: White;**
   - This property sets the text color to white.

4. **Text-align: Center;**
   - This property aligns the text content of the element to the center.

5. **Font-size: 50px;**
   - This property sets the font size of the text content to 50 pixels.

6. **Padding: 20px;**
   - This property sets a padding of 20 pixels within the element.

7. **Margin: 20px;**
   - This property sets a margin of 20 pixels around the element.

8. **Font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;**
   - This property sets the font family for the text content to a fallback system font stack, starting with "Times New Roman".

9. **Border-bottom: 5px solid tomato;**
   - This property sets a 5-pixel solid border at the bottom of the element with the color "tomato".

10. **Border-top: 5px sandybrown solid;**
    - This property seems to have a syntax error. It should be `border-top: 5px solid sandybrown;` to specify the border style correctly.

11. **Border-left: 5px violet solid;**
    - This property sets a 5-pixel solid border on the left side of the element with the color "violet".

12. **Border-right: 5px dodgerblue solid;**
    - This property sets a 5-pixel solid border on the right side of the element with the color "dodgerblue".

The CSS code attempts to style the `h1` element with various visual properties, including colors, borders, and text formatting. However, there are a few syntax errors and missing units that need to be corrected for the styles to be applied correctly.
